;; Grail loads an .emacs configuration in a robust, modular, and mode
;; aware manner.

;; The user has the opportunity to split their emacs configuration
;; into seperate files making it much easier to maintain. If the elisp
;; is sorted into the files treated as special, where grail loads them
;; directly by name, then the configuration will work properly when
;; emacs in started in different modes:

;; * batch mode    - non-interactive library functions only
;; * tty           - a console frame
;; * gui           - a graphical frame
;; * deamon        - a headless emacs server

;; The error trapping in grail catches errors in both errors in grail
;; itself, and in the configuration. This allows Emacs to start
;; containing the errors and reporting them. This is vital to using
;; Emacs to fix such errors :) and avoiding the dreaded --debug-init.

;; The second level of features involve managing load-path and third
;; party code not distributed with emacs itself.

;; It is very common for load-path to evolve, or devolve :) in a
;; hackish way until it is difficult to maintain. The tree structure
;; for a configuration defined by grail is used to construct a
;; load-path that scales from simple configuration to ambitious elisp
;; hacking.

;; There wealth of third party emacs packages provide powerful
;; functionality, but they are a burden to maintain, and especially to
;; replicate across multiple machines.

;; The primary mechanism for managing third party elisp is installing
;; and activating ELPA, the package management system hosted at
;; http://tromey.com/elpa/.  For those packages not hosted by ELPA
;; grail can install them in a limited way.

;; To collalesce a variety of packages into a feature group Grail
;; provides the "profile" configuration files. In a profile file
;; third party elisp is managed with installation and configuration.

;; In a group when elisp packages are missing an install function and
;; a initialization function are generated, with calls to those
;; functions inserted into the scratch buffer. The user can uncomment
;; the functions and execute them to replace the missing peices and
;; execute the configuration bits that depend on them.

;; ---> Starting with Grail.

;; The README.grail file provides installation instructions a more
;; detailed description of the file and directory structure that is
;; significant to Grail.
